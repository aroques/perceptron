# Perceptron

A perceptron learning algorithm in python 3.

## Usage

The program will be expecting a text file that contains training data. Below is an example of such a text file. 2 is the number of features and 4 is the number of rows in the dataset. The rest of the rows are the actual training data and the last column in each of the rows is the row's class label.

```
2 4
0 0 -1
0 1 1
1 0 1
1 1 1
```

**To run this program:**
```
python3.6 main.py filename
```

**For help run:**
```
python3.6 main.py -h
```
